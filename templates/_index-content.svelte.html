        <p>As recreational marijuana gains legal acceptance throughout the nation state-by-state, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/new-bills-would-legalize-recreational-marijuana-in-minnesota/504972682/">Minnesota lawmakers are mulling the drug's status</a>.</p>

        <p>Gov. Tim Walz has expressed openness to legalizing marijuana for recreational use, following the lead of states like Colorado, Washington, Oregon, California and others. </p>

        <p>Marijuana's legal status in Minnesota is complex. On one hand, cannabis has been decriminalized for small doses in Minnesota since the 1970s and available as a treatment for terminal medical conditions since 2015. On the other hand, large racial disparities in enforcement persist statewide and the medical availability of marijuana-based treatments is among the country's most restrictive.</p>

        <p>Here's a rundown of where Minnesota stands on marijuana's legality:</p>

        <p>More than half the country has legalized marijuana in some form. Several others have made cannabis-based oils available to treat various medical conditions. A growing number have allowed marijuana to be sold for recreational use from licensed businesses.</p>

        <p>To states that have legalized marijuana for recreational sales, the additional <span class="legendary green3">tax revenue</span> has been a boon for local budgets. Though since marijuana is still federally considered a prohibited Schedule One drug, legal businesses selling cannabis face various operational challenges.</p>

            <p>Cannabis-based treatments are only legally available from twelve licensed dispensaries serving all of Minnesota's 87 counties.</p>

            <p>Recreationally, small amounts of marijuana in personal possession have been decriminalized in Minnesota since 1976. Any weight less 42.5 grams or less is a petty misdemeanor on first offense, while future offenses are considered felonies.</p>
