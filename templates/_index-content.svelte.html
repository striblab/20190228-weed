        <p>As recreational marijuana gradually gains legal acceptance throughout the nation, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/new-bills-would-legalize-recreational-marijuana-in-minnesota/504972682/">Minnesota lawmakers are mulling the drug's status</a>.</p>

        <p>Gov. Tim Walz has expressed openness to legalizing marijuana for recreational use, following the lead of states like Colorado, Washington, Oregon, California and others. </p>

        <p>Minnesota's relationship with marijuana is complex. On one hand, cannabis has been decriminalized for small doses in Minnesota since the 1970s and available as a treatment for terminal medical conditions since 2014. On the other hand, large racial disparities in enforcement persist statewide and convictions for cannabis-related infractions have climbed.</p>

        <p>Here's a rundown of where Minnesota stands on marijuana's legality:</p>

    <section class="container-lg">
        <h2 class="chartTitle">Minnesota and a greening America</h2>
        <p>More than half the country, including Minnesota, has legalized marijuana in some form, whether it's for medical treatment in various forms or recreational usage and sales.</p>

        <p>Minnesota has one of the nation’s strictest medical marijuana programs, allowing seriously ill patients to ingest concentrated marijuana in edible or vapor form, though prohibiting smoking.</p>

        <p>Qualifying conditions include cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, Tourette Syndrome, ALS, seizures, muscle spasms, Multiple Sclerosis, Chrohn's Disease and any illness deemed terminal.</p>

        <p>Cannabis-based treatments are only legally available from twelve licensed dispensaries serving all of Minnesota's 87 counties.</p>

        <p>Recreationally, small amounts of marijuana in personal possession have been decriminalized in Minnesota since 1976. Any weight less 42.5 grams or less is a petty misdemeanor on first offense, while future offenses are considered felonies.</p>

        <h2 class="chartTitle">Growing revenue</h2>
        <p>States that have legalized marijuana for either medical or recreational sales have seen boons of additional <span class="legendary green3">annual tax revenue (in millions)</span> since instituting those new laws.</p>
        <p>Minnesota's tax on medical marijuana sales has so far earned the state an average of $9 million in revenue each year.</p>

        <p>However, marijuana is still federally considered a prohibited Schedule One drug, so legal businesses selling cannabis face various operational challenges, such as being required to only accept cash from customers.</p>
