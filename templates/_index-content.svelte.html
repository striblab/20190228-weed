        <p>As marijuana use gradually gains legal acceptance throughout the nation, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/new-bills-would-legalize-recreational-marijuana-in-minnesota/504972682/">Minnesota lawmakers are mulling the drug's status</a>, with Gov. Tim Walz expressing openness to following the lead of states where recreational cannabis is allowed, regulated and taxed.</p>

        <p>Cannabis has been medically legal in Minnesota since 2014, and decriminalized in small doses for decades. Yet, while statewide marijuana arrests have decreased, racial disparities in law enforcement persist and felony convictions have risen.</p>

        <p>Here's a rundown of where Minnesota stands on marijuana's legality:</p>

        <h2 class="chartTitle">Minnesota and a greening America</h2>
        <p>Much of the country has legalized cannabis in some form, weather as a medical treatment, as theraputic oils or for recreational usage and sales.</p>

        <p>Minnesota has one of the nation’s strictest medical marijuana programs, allowing only the most seriously ill patients to ingest concentrated cannabis in edible or vapor form, while smoking remains prohibited.</p>

            <p>Cannabis-based treatments are only legally available from about a dozen licensed dispensaries serving Minnesota's 87 counties, and may only be prescribed for terminal conditions like cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, Tourette Syndrome, ALS, seizures, muscle spasms, Multiple Sclerosis or Chrohn's Disease.</p>

            <p>Recreationally, small amounts (less than 42.5 grams) of marijuana in personal possession have been decriminalized in Minnesota since 1976, with a first offense getting a petty misdemeanor and future infractions being considered felonies.</p>

        <h2 class="chartTitle">Growing revenue</h2>
        <p>The marijuana industries in states with legalized medical or recreational cannabis sales have seen boons of additional <span class="legendary green3">annual revenue</span> since the institution of those new laws.</p>

        <p>Minnesota's medical marijuana sales have so far generated about $9 million per year.</p>

        <p>However, marijuana is still federally considered a prohibited Schedule One drug, so legal businesses selling cannabis face various operational challenges, such as being required to only accept cash from customers.</p>

        <h2 class="chartTitle">Changing attitudes</h2>
        <p>American support for recreational legalization of cannibis reached about 66 percent last year, according to Gallup surveys.</p>

        <p>While acceptance of legalized marijuana has gradually increased <span class="legendary green3">nationwide</span> over the decade, support in the <span class="legendary green2">midwest</span> has grown more inconsistently, yet still jumped about 25 points from 2009 to 2018.</p>

        <p>Minnesota and Minneapolis have been painted as having among the worst racial disparities in the country, <a href="http://static.startribune.com/news/legacy-apps/20150427-marijuana/index.html">based in part on the prosecution of marijuana cases</a>.</p>

        <p>A 2013 ACLU study showed black people were about 8 times more likely to be arrested for cannabis possession in Minneapolis than white people, even though usage rates are roughly the same.</p>

        <p>In 2018, Minneapolis announced the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-cops-halt-marijuana-stings-after-almost-all-arrested-were-black/484876151/">cessation of small-scale marijuana stings</a> after discovering that 46 out of 47 suspects arrested were black.</p>
