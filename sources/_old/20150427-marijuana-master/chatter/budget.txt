Nationally, black people are disproportionately convicted of cannabis-related crimes by vast degrees compared both to their population and white people. Similar trends exist in Minnesota, according to three-year case data from the Minnesota Supreme Court, where black people comprise about 5 percent of the population but represent more than 17 percent of cannabis convictions statewide. Meanwhile, whites comprise 56 percent of cannabis convictions despite their 81 percent statewide majority, while also far and away leading in acquitted cases. Hispanic, Asian and Native American populations see proportional or fewer cannabis convictions compared to their populations, leaving the gap between white people and black people the largest.
